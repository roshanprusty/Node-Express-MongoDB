Let's first Understand how fs.readFile and fs.writeFile works

source code --- Read Buffer --- fs.readFile
source code --- Write Buffer --- fs.writeFile

Here actually what is happening is Read buffer used to read the whole data at once and that whole data are stored in system memory.
same gose to for fs.writeFile

To Counter such type of problem STREAM comes into the story
while STREAM what does is, It can process data piece by piece instead of reading or writing the whole data at once.
In short, If the file is too long there stream what do is it will read data chunks by chunks: It will take little data and send it to fs.readStream and then another more chunks. Like this it will continue till the whole data has been read.

Example : Youtube, Netflix

There are 4 types of stream are there:
1. Readable Stream : The readable streams are the one from where we can read or consume data chunk by chunk.

Important readable stream events: data & end
Important readable stream methods: read & pipe

2. Writable Stream : The writable streams are the one where we can write or produce data chunk by chunk.

Important readable stream events: drain & finish
Important readable stream methods: write & end

3. Duplex Stream: Duplex stream is simply a stream that is both readable & writable at the same time.
Example: Web Sockets

4. Transform Stream:  Transform stream are duplex stream which can also modify or Transform data as it is read or written
Example: zlib
