An "uncaught exception" refers to an exception that is thrown by a piece of code but is not caught by any code that can handle it. In other words, an uncaught exception occurs when there is no try-catch block or similar mechanism in place to catch the exception and handle it gracefully. When an uncaught exception occurs, the program will typically terminate abruptly, and the user may see an error message or a stack trace.

On the other hand, an "unhandled exception" refers to an exception that is caught by a piece of code, but there is no specific handler to deal with it. This can happen when a catch block catches a general exception type like "Exception" but doesn't have any specific code to handle that particular exception. In this case, the exception is technically "handled" in the sense that the program won't terminate abruptly, but it's not being dealt with in any meaningful way, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

To summarize, the main difference between an uncaught and an unhandled exception is that an uncaught exception is not caught by any code at all, while an unhandled exception is caught but not handled in a specific way. Both can lead to issues in a program, so it's important to ensure that your code has appropriate exception handling mechanisms in place.
